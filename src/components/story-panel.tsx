          You awaken in a dimly lit chamber. Stone walls surround you,
          weathered by centuries of darkness. A faint glow emanates from
          the eastern corridor, while a heavy iron door blocks the western path.
        </p>
        <p>
          The air is thick with dust. Your inventory feels lighter than you remember.
          Something moves in the shadows above—you hear the faint scratching of claws
          against stone.
        </p>
        <p>
          A choice must be made. The eastern corridor glows with an unknown light.
          The western door demands investigation. And there... beneath the rubble
          to the north... something glimmers.
