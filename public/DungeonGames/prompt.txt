Asset Generation Guide: PlayDungeon Arcade
Use these prompts with your Image Generation AI (Nano Banana, Midjourney, etc.) to create high-quality, dynamic assets.

🎨 Asset Strategy: "The Living Game"
To make the game feel alive (like a moving GIF):

Backdrops: We will generate "Cinemagraph" style images. In the code, we will apply a slow CSS pan/zoom (Ken Burns effect) to make them breathe.
Characters: We will generate "Sprites". If you can generate 2 frames (A and B), we can rapid-swap them in CSS to create an "Idle Animation".
